Installing Anaconda is the best way because it manages packages for my Python application as well as my R application. It comes with the Python Shell as well, just type IDLE into the search bar and voila!

The [introductory tutorial](https://anaconda.cloud/tutorials/getting-started-with-anaconda-individual-edition) has a lot of information on how to set up a package manager, how to create a new environment, etc. It is a good place to get started.

When you want to work on files in a custom folder instead of the default, we could make use of a command window in our environment ([Reference](https://www.planetofbits.com/python/change-jupyter-notebook-startup-folder-anaconda/)).
