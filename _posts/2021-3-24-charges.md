According to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute ([link](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/charge)), a charge is a formal accusation of criminal activity. The prosecuting attorney decides on the charges, after reviewing police reports, witness statements, and any other evidence of wrongdoing. Formal charges are announced at an arrested person's arraignment.

An arraignment is the first step in criminal proceeding where the defendant is brought in front of the court to hear the charges and enter a plea ([link](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/arraignment)).

### Capital Murder

According to the firm Vinas & Graham, the contexts that trigger a capital murder charge come in a few different forms. One is of an aggravated nature, exacerbating what is already murder but with greater intent or callousness.

Another is when the murder is intentional and occurs in the process of carrying out other felonies. Lastly, capital murder protects and applies to certain public servants and government spaces ([link](https://houstoncriminalfirm.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-murder-charge-and-a-capital-murder-charge/)).
