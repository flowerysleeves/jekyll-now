title: Common Headers in Python

For different functionalities, we need different types of headers.

Here is a commonly used one:

```
# Data manipulation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Options for pandas
pd.options.display.max_columns = 50
pd.options.display.max_rows = 30

# Display all cell outputs
from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell
InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = 'all'

from IPython import get_ipython
ipython = get_ipython()

# autoreload extension
if 'autoreload' not in ipython.extension_manager.loaded:
    %load_ext autoreload

%autoreload 2

# Visualizations
import chart_studio.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go
from plotly.offline import iplot, init_notebook_mode
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)

import cufflinks as cf
cf.go_offline(connected=True)
cf.set_config_file(theme='white')
```

If we would like to create a bar chart race, we would use
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
import matplotlib.animation as animation
from IPython.display import HTML
```

If we would like to do mathematical calculations, we would use
```

```
