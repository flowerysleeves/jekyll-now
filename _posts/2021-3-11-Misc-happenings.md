### Mouse Kerfuffle

I got an [ergonomic mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ergonomic-Optical-Vertical-Buttons/dp/B00FPAVUHC/) from Amazon in November 2019. Recently the scroll wheel has not been working very well. When I try to scroll up, it sometimes will scroll down instead. Vice versa. Somehow I thought to Google the brand name and scroll wheel, and came across [this article](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Anker+Vertical+Mouse+Teardown+and+Cleaning/128679), which deals with precisely the problem. I was really unsure about prying open the second tab in Step 2, but it worked like a charm. 

The article pointed out in Step 4 that cleaning the cruft off the thinner scroll wheel axle was enough to solve the problem. However, in my case, it was that the rubber part of the wheel has come apart from the plastic part that turns. I glued them together and put together the mouse. Now the mouse works like new.

This was not the project that I thought I would spend my night on, but I'm glad that the mouse that I like doesn't need to be thrown away, especially when the other parts still work (knock on wood).
