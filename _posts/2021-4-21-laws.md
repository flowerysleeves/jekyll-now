#### Florida
Florida has statutes, constitution, and laws. See source [here](https://www.flsenate.gov/laws/). Citation styles for different documents can be found [here](http://www.fsulawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/florida-style-manual.pdf). Note that since 1997, the laws are not written in book form, but in individual chapters published on the internet ([here](http://laws.flrules.org/)). Therefore, page numbers are not required.
