While cells themselves are highlighted but not the content, we could press `B` to create another one under the current one, `A` to create another one above the current one, `O` to collapse the output for the current cell, and `M` to turn cell from code to markdown. `Y` changes markdown back to code.

`H` shows all shortcuts.
