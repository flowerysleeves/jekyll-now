    - Abstract: Using data from three of the largest cities in the United States, we compare observed crime concentration to a counterfactual distribution of crimes generated by randomizing crimes to street segments. We show that this method avoids a key pitfall that causes a popular method of measuring crime concentration to considerably overstate the degree of crime concentration in a city.

Law's unintended consequences:
- [Podkopacz & Feld](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1144155.pdf): "Extended Jurisdiction Juvenile Prosecution" written into law in Minnesota in 1995 attempts to create a buffer zone before sending juvenile offenders to adult corrections facilities. However, many juvenile offenders were still sent to adult prison due to technical parole violations ("back-door" route to prison).

Policing:
- [Goncalves & Mello (2021)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20181607): "A Few Bad Apples? Racial Bias in Policing". AER.  
    - Abstract: We estimate the degree to which individual police officers practice racial discrimination. Using a bunching estimation design and data from the Florida Highway Patrol, we show that minorities are less likely to receive a discount on their speeding tickets than White drivers. Disaggregating this difference to the individual police officer, we estimate that 42 percent of officers practice discrimination. We then apply our officer-level discrimination measures to various policy-relevant questions in the literature. In particular, reassigning officers across locations based on their lenience can effectively reduce the aggregate disparity in treatment.

    - Abstract: Nearly 1,000 officer-involved killings occur each year in the United States. This article documents the large, racially disparate effects of these events on the educational and psychological well-being of Los Angeles public high school students. Exploiting hyperlocal variation in how close students live to a killing, I find that exposure to police violence leads to persistent decreases in GPA, increased incidence of emotional disturbance, and lower rates of high school completion and college enrollment. These effects are driven entirely by black and Hispanic students in response to police killings of other minorities and are largest for incidents involving unarmed individuals.

Race & Criminal Justice System:
- [Feigenberg & Miller (2021)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20180688): "Racial Divisions and Criminal Justice: Evidence from Southern State Courts"
    - The US criminal justice system is exceptionally punitive. We test whether racial heterogeneity is one cause, exploiting cross-jurisdiction variation in punishment severity in four Southern states. We estimate the causal effect of jurisdiction on arrest outcomes using a fixed effects model that incorporates extensive charge and defendant controls. We validate our estimates using defendants charged in multiple jurisdictions. Consistent with a model of ingroup bias in electorate preferences, the relationship between local severity and Black population share follows an inverted U-shape. Within states, defendants are 27–54 percent more likely to be incarcerated in “peak” heterogeneous jurisdictions than in homogeneous jurisdictions. We estimate that confinement rates and race-based confinement rate gaps would fall by 15 percent if all jurisdictions adopted the severity of homogeneous jurisdictions within their state.

Prisons
- [Mukherjee (2021)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20170474): "Impacts of Private Prison Contracting on Inmate Time Served and Recidivism"
    - This paper examines the impact of private prison contracting by exploiting staggered prison capacity shocks in Mississippi. Motivated by a model based on the typical private prison contract that pays a per diem for each occupied bed, the empirical analysis shows that private prison inmates serve 90 additional days. This is alternatively estimated as 4.8 percent of the average sentence. The delayed release erodes half of the cost savings offered by private contracting and is linked to the greater likelihood of conduct violations in private prisons. The additional days served do not lead to apparent changes in inmate recidivism. (JEL H76, K42)


Use of Google Trends Data:
- [Brodeur et al (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272720302103): COVID-19, lockdowns and well-being: Evidence from Google Trends
  - We look at the effect of COVID-19 and associated lockdowns on population well-being.
  - We use Google Trends data to measure changes in well-being related topic search-terms.
  - We find an increase in searches for boredom, loneliness, worry and sadness.
  - We find a decrease in searches for stress, suicide and divorce.
  - We see evidence of mean-reversion in some (but not all) of the well-being measures.

- [Kearney & Levine (2015)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20140012): Media Influences on Social Outcomes: The Impact of 
MTV’s 16 and Pregnant on Teen Childbearing
  - We supplement this analysis with an exploration of data about online activity to 
determine whether the MTV show influenced viewers’ interest in the topics of birth 
control and abortion, in so far as it is reflected in their Internet search and social 
media activity. In particular, we examine the potential influence of 16 and Pregnant
on teens’ decision-making process with data on the frequency with which teens search for terms like “how to get birth control” or use the terms “birth control” or “abortion” in their tweets. This analysis provides some insight into the mechanisms 
that would lead to changes in rates of teen childbearing in the absence of sufficient data on actual levels of sexual activity and contraceptive use.
