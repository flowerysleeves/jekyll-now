I"8<p>Too bad I couldnâ€™t make it to the symphony tonight, so I listened to the pieces at home.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Anna Thorvaldsdottir - Metacosmos</li>
</ol>

<p>The violins make a very unsettling sound that is high and jarring, giving us the feeling of an uncertain emotion for being in space. Perhaps the new music these days are all experimental like this.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prokofiev - Piano Concerto No. 2</li>
</ol>

<p>Very fun and animated.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sibelius - Symphony No. 2</li>
</ol>

<p>Most similar to traditional classical music that I am used to.</p>
