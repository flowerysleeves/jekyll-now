<p>Several tricks here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We donâ€™t need to change the dataframe names in the code. We could just create dataframes with the names df and dff.</li>
  <li>We donâ€™t need to change the column names of the original dataframes, we could change the column names of df and dff to match with what is in the post.</li>
  <li>The best way to work with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">animator.save()</code> is to save it as .mp4 and then use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg -i C:\my_path\animation.mp4 C:\my_path\animation.gif</code> in cmd to convert the mp4 file into gif. Or we could just embed the mp4 file.</li>
</ol>
