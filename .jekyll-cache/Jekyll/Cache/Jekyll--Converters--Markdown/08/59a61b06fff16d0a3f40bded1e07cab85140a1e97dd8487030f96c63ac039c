I"+<p>There is this concept of percent suicide by gun (PSG), which means the percent of suicides that are conducted by the gun. This measure is used as a proxy for gun ownership, because the more guns there are, the higher probability of using the gun to commit suicide. This data is obtained from the Center for Disease Control. Tracing the time trends for each state, we can see that for states that passed the law, the PSG measure of a large number of them increases, breaking the trend. The other states mostly see this measure decreasing over time.</p>
